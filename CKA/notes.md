### Containerization technology

**Containerization technology** is a method of packaging an application and all its dependencies (like libraries, configuration files, and runtime) into a single, lightweight, and portable unit called a container.

A **container** is an isolated environment that runs on top of an operating system’s kernel. Unlike virtual machines, containers don’t need a separate OS — they share the host OS but still behave as if they have their own system.
