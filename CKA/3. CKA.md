**API Server** - The Kubernetes API server is a central component of the Kubernetes control plane, acting as the front-end for the entire cluster. It exposes the Kubernetes API, which is a RESTful API used to manage, create, and configure Kubernetes clusters and their resources.

**Scheduler** - 

**Controller Manager** - It’s the automation brain. Continuously checks what’s running vs. what should be running.

Example:If a Pod crashes and you asked for 3 Pods — Controller Manager says, “Hey! Only 2 Pods are alive. Let’s make one more.”

**etcd** - A key-value database that stores everything about your cluster. It’s like Kubernetes’ memory or hard drive.
**kubelet** - 
**kube-proxy** - 
**kubeadm** - 
**Pod** -
