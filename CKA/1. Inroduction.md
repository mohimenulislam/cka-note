### Containerization technology

**Containerization technology** is a method of packaging an application and all its dependencies (like libraries, configuration files, and runtime) into a single, lightweight, and portable unit called a container.

A **container** is an isolated environment that runs on top of an operating system’s kernel. Unlike virtual machines, containers don’t need a separate OS — they share the host OS but still behave as if they have their own system.


**Physical hardware must have “PRDN”**
- P - Processor
- R - RAM
- D - Disk
- N - Network

### Image
An image is a file that contains the source code, dependencies, libraries, tools, and other files needed for the application to run.

### BaseOS
BaseOS means the foundation operating system layer. It includes the essential system libraries, kernel modules, and utilities needed for an environment to function.

### Container
- A container is a lightweight, isolated runtime environment created from an image.
- It shares the host OS kernel but runs apps independently.
- Each container behaves like a separate machine but uses fewer resources than a full VM.
- Think of it as a “running instance” of an image.

### Persistent Volume
A Persistent Volume (PV) is a piece of storage in a Kubernetes cluster (or containerized system) that exists independently of any pod or container. It’s storage that keeps data safe even if the container or pod is deleted or restarted.

### Name Space
Types of Namespaces: There are various types of namespaces, each isolating a different aspect of the system:
- `PID Namespace:` Isolates process IDs, allowing processes within a namespace to have their own independent PID tree, starting from PID 1.
- `Mount Namespace:` Isolates filesystem mount points, providing each namespace with its own view of the filesystem hierarchy.
- `Network Namespace:` Isolates network resources like network interfaces, routing tables, and firewall rules, creating independent network stacks.
- `UTS Namespace:` Isolates hostname and NIS domain name, allowing different hostnames within different namespaces.
- `IPC Namespace:` Isolates Inter-Process Communication (IPC) resources like message queues, semaphores, and shared memory.
- `User Namespace:` Isolates user and group IDs, allowing for different user mappings within a namespace, enhancing security.
- `Cgroup Namespace:` Isolates cgroup hierarchies, enabling independent management of resource limits.
- `Time Namespace:` Isolates the system's time, allowing processes within a namespace to have a different perception of time.
