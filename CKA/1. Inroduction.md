### Containerization technology 

**Containerization technology** is a method of packaging an application and all its dependencies (like libraries, configuration files, and runtime) into a single, lightweight, and portable unit called a container.

A **container** is an isolated environment that runs on top of an operating system’s kernel. Unlike virtual machines, containers don’t need a separate OS — they share the host OS but still behave as if they have their own system.


**Physical hardware must have “PRDN”**
- P - Processor
- R - RAM
- D - Disk
- N - Network

### Image
An image is a file that contains the source code, dependencies, libraries, tools, and other files needed for the application to run.

### BaseOS
BaseOS means the foundation operating system layer. It includes the essential system libraries, kernel modules, and utilities needed for an environment to function.

### Container
- A container is a lightweight, isolated runtime environment created from an image.
- It shares the host OS kernel but runs apps independently.
- Each container behaves like a separate machine but uses fewer resources than a full VM.
- Think of it as a “running instance” of an image.
- Each container has generate a process

### Container Inngine
A container engine is a piece of software that accepts user requests, including command line options, pulls images, and from the end user's perspective runs the container. There are many container engines, including:
- Docker Engine - Developed by Docker,Inc - March 20,2013
- RKT(ROCKET)
- LXC/LXd >> LXC - Release 2008
- CRI-0(Podman)

### Container Repository 
A repository is a collection of container images in a registry that 
have the same name, but different tags. For example, the following 
three images are in the nginx repository:
- nginx:latest
- nginx:v1
- nginx:v2

### Container Registry 
A container registry is a service that stores and distributes container 
images and related artifacts. Container serves as a general catalog 
of Docker container images.
- Docker Hub
- Red Hat Quay
- Alibaba Container Registry
- Google Container Registry
- And Many more …


### Persistent Volume
A Persistent Volume (PV) is a piece of storage in a Kubernetes cluster (or containerized system) that exists independently of any pod or container. It’s storage that keeps data safe even if the container or pod is deleted or restarted.

### Name Space
Types of Namespaces: There are various types of namespaces, each isolating a different aspect of the system:
- `PID Namespace:` Isolates process IDs, allowing processes within a namespace to have their own independent PID tree, starting from PID 1.
- `Mount Namespace:` Isolates filesystem mount points, providing each namespace with its own view of the filesystem hierarchy.
- `Network Namespace:` Isolates network resources like network interfaces, routing tables, and firewall rules, creating independent network stacks.
- `UTS Namespace:` Isolates hostname and NIS domain name, allowing different hostnames within different namespaces.
- `IPC Namespace:` Isolates Inter-Process Communication (IPC) resources like message queues, semaphores, and shared memory.
- `User Namespace:` Isolates user and group IDs, allowing for different user mappings within a namespace, enhancing security.
- `Cgroup Namespace:` Isolates cgroup hierarchies, enabling independent management of resource limits.
- `Time Namespace:` Isolates the system's time, allowing processes within a namespace to have a different perception of time.

### NAT
Network Address Translation, is a process that allows multiple devices on a private network to share a single public IP address when connecting to the internet. 

A router acts as an intermediary, modifying the IP addresses in the packet headers to translate private internal addresses to a public one before sending data to an external network, and translating the public response back to the original private address. 


### SNAT: Source Network Address Translation (Masking)
Private IP to Public IP

SNAT, or Source Network Address Translation, is a network technique that modifies the source IP address and port of outgoing packets to an external network, allowing multiple private IP addresses to share a single public IP address, thus conserving public IP space and enabling private network devices to access the internet.

Private IP addresses (like 192.168.x.x or 10.x.x.x) are not routable on the internet.
So before traffic leaves the LAN, the router/firewall replaces the private source IP with its public IP.


### DNAT: Destination Network Address Translation (Port forwarding)
Public IP to Private IP

DNAT, as the name suggests, is a technique that translates the destination IP address generally when connecting from a public IP address to a private IP address.

Private IPs like 192.168.x.x are not accessible from the internet.
If you host a service (like a web server) inside your LAN, DNAT allows the router/firewall to forward incoming traffic from its public IP to that internal server.

If a container running inside your private or host network is accessible from the internet, then DNAT is definitely used.


### docker0 (Virtual Switch, IP: 172.17.0.1/16)
`docker0` is the default bridge network interface created by Docker to connect containers to each other and to the host system's network.
