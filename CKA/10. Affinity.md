## Affinity
- nodeAffinity
- podAffinity
You can indicate that a rule is soft or preferred, so that the scheduler still schedules the Pod even if it can't find a matching node.

### nodeAffinity
There are two types of node affinity:
- 1. requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
- 2. preferredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
 
#### requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution: 
The scheduler can't schedule the Pod unless the rule is met. Like nodeSelector, but with a more expressive syntax.


#### preferredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution: 
The scheduler tries to find a node that meets the rule. If a matching node is not available, the scheduler still schedules the Pod.

### podAffinity (Inter-pod affinity/anti-affinity) 
You can constrain a Pod using labels on other Pods running on the node (or other topological domain), instead of just node labels, which allows you to define rules for which Pods can be co-located on a node.

Inter-pod affinity/anti-affinity allows you to constrain Pods against labels on other Pods.
